            <p>Anxiety symptoms are common in children and adolescents, with 10-20% of school-aged children experiencing anxiety symptoms. Children can learn to cope with anxiety by learning a few crucial skills. Teaching children and adolescents how to manage their own anxiety can go a long way in helping them feel better.</p>
<p>FIVE can help kids learn ways to manage their fears and reduce their anxieties. It teaches our kids coping strategies so they can use them to help them deal with whatever troubling event they encounter as well as boosting their resilience for life. They can use the exercises or they can add their own favourites. Whatever makes them feel less anxious, and calmer.
