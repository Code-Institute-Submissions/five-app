# FIVE


‘FIVE’ is a wellness website/app focused on children and young teens that suffer from anxiety and stress. A much simpler format than current wellness apps, with the focus on the users own self-prescribed forms of ‘mindfulness’. Too many apps come with pre-prescribed ‘meditation’ routines that are an adults idea of what would be good for young teens, rather than creating an app that teens can use and edit themselves to suit their own personal needs.
The principles behind the design are based on a simple ‘task manager app’, the user can input, edit, delete and personalise mindfulness routines that work. The inspiration for FIVE came from the 5 steps of a simple yet effective grounding exercise. Seeing many routies come in ‘5’ steps, 5 breaths, etc, I created FIVE as a simple app for young teens.
The site was built using Gitpod, Github and Heroku. 

You can see the deployed Heroku site here: “https://five-5.herokuapp.com/”

## Project Outline
This website/app deploys all my course learning to date with the Code Institute. The elements I used in creating this website, are all practical techniques I have been learning, working through the Data Centric modules of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

## User Experience

### Research:
I carried out some research on creating apps for children and teens, and found lots of great websites and articles, (links and further reading below).
 - https://www.toptal.com/designers/interactive/guide-to-apps-for-children
 - https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/building-apps-for-children/
 - https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/07/design-for-kids-digital-products-for-playing-and-learning.php

 Learning outcomes include using clean design with bright colours, simplicity. Obvious consistency across the design, a reason to use the app, let them be able to make mistakes, and easily fix them. A learning process through using the app.
